 * \class QtAws::WorkMail::CreateGroupResponse
 * \brief The CreateGroupResponse class provides an interace for WorkMail CreateGroup responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsWorkMail
 *
 *  Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for existing desktop and mobile
 *  email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or other native
 *  iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control both
 *  the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is
 * 
 *  stored>
 * 
 *  The WorkMail API is designed for the following
 * 
 *  scenarios> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Listing and describing
 * 
 *  organization> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>

 *  Managing

 *  group> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Managing
 * 
 *  resource> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  All WorkMail API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS
 *  SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help facilitate
 *  access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the WorkMail site, the IAM
 *  user gains full administrative visibility into the entire WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This
 *  includes, but is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources. This allows
 *  developers to perform the scenarios listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis
 *  using the IAM
